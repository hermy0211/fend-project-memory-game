## Instructions

This is a code for a quick and easy memory game, made while taking Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree.
Here is how to play the game:

- Open the file 'index.html' on any browser
- Pick a card from the deck and match it with the same card
- Once all of your cards have been matched, a pop up will appear showing you how well you did
- Your star rating will update based on the number of moves you make

Have fun!


## Current Functionality

Basic functionality is built, including the following:

- Basic HTML structure
- Basic styling for the deck of cards and score board
- Successfully responses to the browser width
- Star rating, timer, restart button, and card functionality


## Contributing

The code is currently missing animations for the cards, and I intend to improve the design as well.

I am also looking for someone to help me out with temporarily disabling the cards while the setTimeout function is running (104:121 on the app.js file). For now, I have decreased the time to 200ms so the user will not accidentally click on another card while cardMatch() is running.

If you have any solutions to the problems I mentioned above, or another other suggestions, feel free to add a pull request and I will see if it seems fit!
