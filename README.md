## Instructions

This is a code for a quick and easy memory game, made while taking Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree.
Basic functionality is built, including the following:

- Basic HTML structure
- Basic styling for the deck of cards and score board
- Successfully responses to the browser width
- Star rating, timer, restart button, and card functionality

## Contributing

The code is currently missing animations for the cards, and I intend to improve the design as well.
However, if you have another other suggestions, feel free to add a pull request and I will see if it seems fit!
